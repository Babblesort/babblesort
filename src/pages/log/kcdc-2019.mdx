I attended the Kansas City Developer Conference this year on July 18th and 19th.
I've had the great fortune of becoming friends with Jeff Straus, one of the conference directors,
through his association with World Wide Technology where I also work. He is a remarkable person who has
a tremendous skill in bringing people together to build communities. It gives him real pleasure to create
opportunities for people to meet and grow and have them rise to the opportunity. It was at Jeff's
suggestion that I applied for sponsorship and was able to attend and have the conference
fee, hotel, and food expenses covered by WWT.

I had a great time at the conference. Three talks that stood out for me escpecially were
Joe Karlsson's talk _Building Performant React Applications_, Ash xxxx's talk on avoiding UX pitfalls,
and Cory House's talk on building accessible web applications.
