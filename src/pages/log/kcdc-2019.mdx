I attended the [Kansas City Developer Conference](https://www.kcdc.info/) this year on July 18th and 19th.
I've had the great fortune of becoming friends with [Jeff Straus](https://twitter.com/jeffreystrauss), one of the conference directors,
through his association with World Wide Technology where I also work. He is a remarkable person who has
an enviable skill bringing people together to build communities. Nothing seems to give him more pleasure than creating
opportunities for people to meet and grow and then see them rise to the opportunity. It was at Jeff's
suggestion that I applied for sponsorship and was able to attend and have the conference
fee, hotel, and food expenses covered by WWT.

I had a great time at the conference. Three talks that stood out for me escpecially were
[Joe Karlsson's](https://twitter.com/JoeKarlsson1) talk _Building High Performance React Applications_, [Ash Banaszek's](https://twitter.com/ashbzak)
talk _User Experience Pitfalls_, and [Cory House's](https://twitter.com/housecor) talk _Building Accessible Web Apps_.

Ash's talk on approaches to avoid common UX pitfalls was one of the best I've ever seen. She combined a relaxed funny
style with laser focus and clarity on her topic. Ash went on to win [PubConf](https://pubconf.io/events/2017/kansascity.html)
on Friday night. PubConf is a hysterical event where speakers from the related conference prepare 20 slides shown for 15 seconds each
to give a high speed funny talk satarizing some tech topic in the context of a given theme. The three finalists go on to give another talk, this time with a
slide deck they've never seen. Ash had amazing comic timing and was a clear winner and audience favorite. It was her first time
appearing at PubConf and she beat out finalists who had both won prior PubConf events.

Cory House had a fun bit with donning a blindfold for a live coding exercise to demonstrate the use of a screen reader.
He showed simple HTML changes to create better semantic page structures that shifted the screen reader experience from gibberish
to surprisingly easy to follow.
